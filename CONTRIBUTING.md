# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to TaskFlow Pro.

## Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and well-scoped.
- Maintain the existing architectural patterns (feature modules, store/service separation).
- Use TypeScript and the Vue 3 Composition API.
- Run checks before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## Pull Requests

- Include a short description of the problem and the solution.
- Add screenshots for UI changes.
- Avoid unrelated refactors.
